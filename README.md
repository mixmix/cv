## Projects

The skills I offer are intimately linked with the projects I've chosen to work on.
A lot of these are a little off the beaten track, so you can expect me to have performed many roles. I'm usually working on/ with more than one project at a time.

Here's an overview of the projects that have been most important to me and **why**.

### Scuttlebutt <span class='fs-1'>December 2015 - ongoing</span>

Decentralisation gives birth to an open platform that lives without servers and internet, and already offers the best of facebook, goodreads, meetup, github, (and more). The database is p2p, and the interface is designed for community instead of capitalism. Has a passionate community of hundreds of peers from across the world.
